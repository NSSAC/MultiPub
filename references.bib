abstract = {Ranked lists are encountered in research and daily life and it is often of interest to compare these lists even when they are incomplete or have only some members in common. An example is document rankings returned for the same query by different search engines. A measure of the similarity between incomplete rankings should handle nonconjointness, weight high ranks more heavily than low, and be monotonic with increasing depth of evaluation; but no measure satisfying all these criteria currently exists. In this article, we propose a new measure having these qualities, namely rank-biased overlap (RBO). The RBO measure is based on a simple probabilistic user model. It provides monotonicity by calculating, at a given depth of evaluation, a base score that is non-decreasing with additional evaluation, and a maximum score that is nonincreasing. An extrapolated score can be calculated between these bounds if a point estimate is required. RBO has a parameter which determines the strength of the weighting to top ranks. We extend RBO to handle tied ranks and rankings of different lengths. Finally, we give examples of the use of the measure in comparing the results produced by public search engines and in assessing retrieval systems in the laboratory.},

	title = {Evaluating Differentially Private Machine Learning in Practice},
	abstract = {Diﬀerential privacy is a strong notion for privacy that can be used to prove formal guarantees, in terms of a privacy budget, , about how much information is leaked by a mechanism. When used in privacy-preserving machine learning, the goal is typically to limit what can be inferred from the model about individual training records. However, the calibration of the privacy budget is not well understood. Implementations of privacy-preserving machine learning often select large values of in order to get acceptable utility of the model, with little understanding of the impact of such choices on meaningful privacy. Moreover, in scenarios where iterative learning procedures are used, relaxed deﬁnitions of diﬀerential privacy are often used which appear to reduce the needed privacy budget but present poorly understood trade-oﬀs between privacy and utility. In this paper, we quantify the impact of these choices on privacy in experiments with logistic regression and neural network models. Our main ﬁnding is that there is no way to obtain privacy for free—relaxed deﬁnitions of diﬀerential privacy that reduce the amount of noise needed to improve utility also increase the measured privacy leakage. Current mechanisms for diﬀerentially private machine learning rarely oﬀer acceptable utility-privacy trade-oﬀs for complex learning tasks: settings that provide limited accuracy loss provide little eﬀective privacy, and settings that provide strong privacy result in useless models.},

	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to build a system that automatically creates synthetic data to enable data science endeavors. To achieve this, we present the Synthetic Data Vault ({SDV}), a system that builds generative models of relational databases. We are able to sample from the model and create synthetic data, hence the name {SDV}. When implementing the {SDV}, we also developed an algorithm that computes statistics at the intersection of related database tables. We then used a state-of-the-art multivariate modeling approach to model this data. The {SDV} iterates through all possible relations, ultimately creating a model for the entire database. Once this model is computed, the same relational information allows the {SDV} to synthesize data by sampling from any part of the database. After building the {SDV}, we used it to generate synthetic data for five different publicly available datasets. We then published these datasets, and asked data scientists to develop predictive models for them as part of a crowdsourced experiment. By analyzing the outcomes, we show that synthetic data can successfully replace original data for data science. Our analysis indicates that there is no significant difference in the work produced by data scientists who used synthetic data as opposed to real data. We conclude that the {SDV} is a viable solution for synthetic data generation.},

While there have been impressive advances in machine learning and similar domains in recent years, this also gives rise to concerns regarding the protection of personal and otherwise sensitive data, especially if it is to be analysed by third parties. Besides anonymisation, which becomes challenging with high dimensional data, one approach for privacy-preserving data mining lies in the usage of synthetic data, which comes with the promise of protecting the users’ data and producing analysis results close to those achieved by using real data. In this paper, we analyse a number of different approaches for creating synthetic data, and study the utility of the created datasets for regression tasks, i.e. the prediction of a numeric value. We further investigate the similarity of real and synthetic data samples. Finally, we contribute to privacy assessments and measurements of the risk of attribute disclosure on synthetic data by extending an approach developed for categorical data.},

The data owners need not release their data, while potential collaborators can begin developing models and methods with some confidence that their results will work similarly on the real dataset. The distinguishing feature of {DataSynthesizer} is its usability --- the data owner does not have to specify any parameters to start generating and sharing data safely and effectively. {DataSynthesizer} consists of three high-level modules --- {DataDescriber}, {DataGenerator} and {ModelInspector}. The first, {DataDescriber}, investigates the data types, correlations and distributions of the attributes in the private dataset, and produces a data summary, adding noise to the distributions to preserve privacy. {DataGenerator} samples from the summary computed by {DataDescriber} and outputs synthetic data. {ModelInspector} shows an intuitive description of the data summary that was computed by {DataDescriber}, allowing the data owner to evaluate the accuracy of the summarization process and adjust any parameters, if desired. We describe {DataSynthesizer} and illustrate its use in an urban science context, where sharing sensitive, legally encumbered data between agencies and with outside collaborators is reported as the primary obstacle to data-driven governance.

The conflict between privacy and utility has triggered intensive research in the computer science and statistics communities, who have developed a variety of methods for privacy-preserving data release. Among the main concepts that have emerged are anonymity and differential privacy. Today, another solution is gaining traction, synthetic data. However, the road to privacy is paved with {NP}-hard problems. In this paper, we focus on the {NP}-hard challenge to develop a synthetic data generation method that is computationally efficient, comes with provable privacy guarantees and rigorously quantifies data utility. We solve a relaxed version of this problem by studying a fundamental, but a first glance completely unrelated, problem in probability concerning the concept of covariance loss. Namely, we find a nearly optimal and constructive answer to the question how much information is lost when we take conditional expectation. Surprisingly, this excursion into theoretical probability produces mathematical techniques that allow us to derive constructive, approximately optimal solutions to difficult applied problems concerning microaggregation, privacy and synthetic data.},

The records in a synthetic dataset are artificially created and thus do not directly relate to individuals in the original data in terms of a 1-to-1 correspondence. As a result, inferences about said individuals appear to be infeasible and, simultaneously, the utility of the data may be kept at a high level. In this paper, we challenge this belief by interpreting the standard attacker model for attribute disclosure as classification problem. We show how disclosure risk measures presented in recent publications may be compared to or even be reformulated as machine learning classification models. Our overall goal is to empirically analyze attribute disclosure risk in synthetic data and to discuss its close relationship to data utility. Moreover, we improve the baseline for attribute disclosure risk from the attacker's perspective by applying variants of the {RadiusNearestNeighbor} and the {EnsembleVote} classifier.},

The underlying framework is constructed using a bottom-up approach. Diverse open-source surveys and first principles models are used for end-use modeling. Extensive validation of the synthetic dataset has been conducted through comparisons with reported energy-use data. We present a detailed, open, high resolution, residential energy-use dataset for the United States.},

	abstract = {Producing timely, well-informed and reliable forecasts for an ongoing epidemic of an emerging infectious disease is a huge challenge. Epidemiologists and policy makers have to deal with poor data quality, limited understanding of the disease dynamics, rapidly changing social environment and the uncertainty on effects of various interventions in place. Under this setting, detailed computational models provide a comprehensive framework for integrating diverse data sources into a well-defined model of disease dynamics and social behavior, potentially leading to better understanding and actions. In this paper, we describe one such agent-based model framework developed for forecasting the 2014–2015 Ebola epidemic in Liberia, and subsequently used during the Ebola forecasting challenge. We describe the various components of the model, the calibration process and summarize the forecast performance across scenarios of the challenge. We conclude by highlighting how such a data-driven approach can be refined and adapted for future epidemics, and share the lessons learned over the course of the challenge.},
